# Digital Twin (Gazebo + Unity)

## Overview

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical system that enables simulation, analysis, and optimization of real-world processes. In robotics, digital twins play a crucial role in developing, testing, and validating robotic systems before deployment in the physical world. This module explores the creation and utilization of digital twins using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for visualization and advanced rendering.
