# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation using Docusaurus, Claude Code, and Spec-Kit Plus Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy and Verifiability
All information MUST be accurate and verifiable from reputable sources.

### Clarity and Accessibility
Explanations MUST be clear and suitable for beginner–intermediate developers.

### Reproducibility
All steps, commands, and examples MUST be fully reproducible.

### Best Practices for AI Writing & SSG
Follow best practices for AI-assisted writing and static site generation.

### Traceable and Cited Claims
All factual claims MUST be traceable to sources (APA style). Source mix: ~40% official documentation, ~30% academic/peer-reviewed, ~30% reputable technical sources. Zero plagiarism; all content MUST be original or properly cited.

### Writing Clarity and Consistency
Writing clarity: Flesch-Kincaid grade 8–10. Consistent structure for all chapters (overview, steps, examples, troubleshooting, citations).

## Constraints

- Word count: 8,000–12,000 words.
- Minimum 20 sources + minimum 8 diagrams/screenshots.
- Output: Docusaurus Markdown + GitHub Pages deployment + final PDF.

## Success Criteria

- Book builds in Docusaurus without errors and deploys to GitHub Pages successfully.
- All claims are verified and properly cited.
- Zero plagiarism and consistent writing across chapters.
- Spec-Kit Plus validation passes.

## Governance

The constitution defines the foundational principles and standards for the project.
Amendments to this constitution require a documented proposal, approval by key stakeholders, and a migration plan if necessary to ensure compliance.
